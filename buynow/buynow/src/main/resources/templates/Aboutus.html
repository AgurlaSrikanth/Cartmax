<h4 style="text-align:justify">Impact on employment 
  E-commerce helps create new job opportunities due to information related services, software app and digital products.
  It also causes job losses. The areas with the greatest predicted job-loss are retail, postal, and travel agencies. 
  The development of e-commerce will create jobs that require highly skilled workers to manage large amounts of information.
  
  Impact on customers
  E-commerce brings convenience for customers as they do not have to leave home and only need to browse website online,
  especially for buying the products which are not sold in nearby shops. 
  It could help customers buy wider range of products and save customers' time.
   
  Impact on the environment
  The recycling rate in Europe is 80 percent and Asia is 93 percent. Amazon, the largest user of boxes,
  has a strategy to cut back on packing material and has reduced packaging material used by 19 percent by weight since 2016.
  Amazon is requiring retailers to manufacture their product packaging in a way that doesn't require additional shipping packaging. 
  
  Impact on traditional retail
  E-commerce has been cited as a major force for the failure of major U.S. retailers in a trend frequently referred to as a "retail apocalypse.
  The rise of e-commerce outlets like Amazon has made it harder for traditional retailers to attract customers to their stores and forced companies
  to change their sales strategies.</h4>
